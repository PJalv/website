Here I talk about my Early Life as well as the steps that have shaped my interest in technology.
# Introduction

Hey, I'm Jorge Suarez!

I am a senior computer engineering student at Cal Poly Pomona, passionate about learning and using new technology to create cool stuff. I am currently really into working on both embedded systems as well as web and cloud development. Here, you can find some of my school projects, including my Senior Design Project, among other things I set myself to create. Enjoy!

## Background

### Early Years (2000s - 2010s)
I have always been around technology, specifically computers. My first memories with a computer were on my dad's Dell laptop running Windows Vista when I was maybe 7 or 8 years old. At first, I played games on it, but if I ever wanted to do anything else, I would end up triggering the Administrator warning and need my dad's password. I remember thinking, "I can't wait to get my computer so I can do anything I want to."

### Growing Passion (2010s - 2012)
From there, my interest in technology grew, acco:w
mpanied by consoles like PlayStations and Nintendo portables. Slowly but steadily, my passion grew for computers and consumer electronics. If I ever ran into issues while using them, I quickly made myself acquainted with Google search and user forums to find solutions. Soon enough, I became the family's IT guy, and to this day, I get requests from friends and family regarding new purchases or help with their devices.

### Middle School (2012 - 2015)
Once I entered middle school, I became part of the STEM programs. I would have one class every year where we worked on a plethora of hands-on projects. I felt at home, being able to collaborate with group members about decisions and task management. Through my years in middle school, I started to realize that a potential path for my future could be engineering. This was also the start of the tinkerer in me. Getting access to tablets like the Kindle Fire and iPods/iPads introduced me to the hacking and modding communities. I proceeded to perform jailbreaks (üçç) and rooting of my devices, knowing very well that it would void my warranty, but the risk was worth it. I had bragging rights around school, since I was able to add as many Diamonds as I wanted in Minecraft Pocket Edition. A vital class I took here was one where we learned to use Scratch, a block-based visual programming language. It was my introduction to the world of programming.

### High School (2015 - 2019)
Entering high school in 2016, my enthusiasm remained, and apart from doing engineering classes and learning about engineering processes, I began to dabble in making custom solutions for my peculiar gaming needs. My first tool was a sniping bot for the FIFA 16 web app. It was a way to buy certain items at a rare, lower cost, and I set myself to create a way to automate the process. I used AutoIt and learned how to simulate key presses and mouse clicks with coordinates. I remember the thrill of waking up for school and checking my laptop that I kept running overnight to see that I had successfully sniped a card!

The one class that I took in this part of my School was AP Computer Science. Here I was introduced to Python, which tends to be the starting language for new programmers, me included. I believe it was a solid foundation, since I was now able to create anything I felt like I needed, without relying on a scripting language like AutoIt.
When it came to deciding what was next for my education, I knew I wanted to work with/on computers. 2018 & 2019 were the years I was introduced to the world of custom build PCs. Up to this point I had only used laptops, so seeing this for the first time really opened my eyes. It was at this point that I knew that for College, I wanted to build my own PC, to have a solid piece of tech for any needs, and needs I had, which I will explain. I decided to apply to some colleges for Computer Engineering. It just made more sense to me over Computer Science, which at that time I had no idea of the differences (and at times I still cant).

## Present and Future

### University Projects and Interests (2019 - Present)
Now, as a senior at Cal Poly Pomona, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have shaped my skills and interests. Although a large part of my College Life was hindered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was still able to work on both personal projects, things that I set out to do to make my life easier. That was also the time when I began taking the programming classes. Working with C and C++, among other things.
One of the most significant experiences has been my Senior Design Project, where I worked on [briefly describe the project]. This project allowed me to dive deep into [related technologies or concepts], and I am excited to share more about it in a future post.

### Current Interests
Currently, I am focused on embedded systems, web development, and cloud technologies. I enjoy creating projects that integrate these fields, such as [mention a specific project or two]. These projects allow me to explore innovative solutions and stay updated with the latest technological advancements.

### Future Goals
Looking ahead, I aim to continue developing my skills in these areas and apply them to real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in exploring [mention a specific future interest or goal], and I plan to share my journey and learnings through this blog.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Stay tuned for more updates, project showcases, and insights into the world of technology!
